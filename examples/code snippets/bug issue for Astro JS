astro js bug issue

create astro or create astro@latest inside a containing directory for a stack like project breaks after a dependecy install and running the dev script. It refuses to boot up the localhost client to see the dev server in your browser. But when ran as a plain single project, it runs just fine. Here si some bash output:

from a directory:

> better-bar@0.0.1 dev
> astro dev

sh: 1: astro: not found

from a single outside project:

$ astro dev

 astro  v4.4.15 ready in 317 ms

┃ Local    http://localhost:4321/
┃ Network  use --host to expose
